# Landing page
Made after approximately 3 months of learning frontend for a client. Designed and coded single-handedly

## What you can do
View the landing and send an email.

## Technologies used:
- HTML5/Kit, <br>
- SASS/SCSS, <br>
- Vanilla JS.

## Biggest issues:
Maintaining big files of HTML and JS, whenever client demanded changes I needed to go through lots of HTML lines copying/pasting and tweaking them a little bit to adjust the layout and behaviour along with JS changes. It wasn't that bad, but it consumed time and was prone to errors. Thankfully to that, I really appreciate learning imports and working with components.

Another big issue that I have encountered was sending the email as I had never encountered working with backend back then, so I have tried different approaches including using Node.js and PHP with Nodemailer and PHPMailer, respectively. These did work, but in the first case the hosting didn't include a VPS, so Node.js couldn't run alongside, as for the PHP the server did manage it after updating its version to 8.1, but I couldn't get Google Gmail API full authorization or neither did know how to restore it automatically so I have looked
for another solution, which I have found after a while. I decided to use another library - EmailJS - which is easy to use and works as intended.

## Conclusion
Planning more things ahead before starting the project would help me a lot with coding. However, I am pleased about the way the project turned out - it serves its purpose and has teached me many things.
