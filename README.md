# Landing page
Made after approximately 3 months of learning frontend for a client. Designed and coded single-handedly

## Biggest issues:
Maintaining such a big file of HTML and JS, whenever client demanded changes I needed to go through HTML lines and copy/paste and change them a little bit to adjust the layout and behaviour along with JS changes. Now thankfully to that, I really appreciate
imports and component-based programming.

Another big issue that I have encountered was sending the email as I haven't learned much backend back then, even now, so I have tried different approaches including Node.js, PHP with PHPMailer. These did work, but in the first case the hosting didn't
include a server, so Node.js couldn't run alongside, as for the PHP the server did manage it after updating it to version 8.1 but I couldn't get Google Gmail API full authorization or neither did know how to restore it automatically so I have looked
for another solution. After a while, I have found it - EmailJS - which is easy to use and works correctly.

Also, I should have planned more things ahead while doing the project, such a plan would help me a lot with coding. However, I am pleased about the way the project turned out - it serves its purpose.

## Technologies used:
- HTML5/Kit, <br>
- SASS/SCSS, <br>
- Vanilla JS.
